                    The C programming language is a general purpose programming
                    language, which relates closely to the way machines work.
                    Understanding how computer memory works is an important aspect of
                    the C programming language. Although C can be considered as "hard
                    to learn", C is in fact a very simple language, with very powerful
                    capabilities. C is a very common language, and it is the language
                    of many applications such as Windows, the Python interpreter, Git,
                    and many many more. C is a compiled language - which means that in
                    order to run it, the compiler (for example, GCC or Visual Studio)
                    must take the code that we wrote, process it, and then create an
                    executable file. This file can then be executed, and will do what
                    we intended for the program to do.

                Every C program uses libraries, which give the ability to execute necessary functions. For example, the
                most basic function called printf, which prints to the screen, is defined in the stdio.h header file.
                <code>#include(stdio.h) 
              *Note : () as a brackets marks.
            </code>

            <p>
            <h3>Data Types</h3>
            C has several types of variables, but there are a few basic types:
            <ol>Integers - whole numbers which can be either positive or negative. Defined using char, int, short, long
                or long long.</ol>
            <ol>Unsigned integers - whole numbers which can only be positive. Defined using unsigned char, unsigned int,
                unsigned short, unsigned long or unsigned long long.

            </ol>

            <ol>
                Floating point numbers - real numbers (numbers with fractions). Defined using float and double.
            </ol>

            <ol>
                Structures - will be explained later, in the Structures section.
            </ol>
            </p>
            <p>
                The different types of variables define their bounds. A char can range only from -128 to 127, whereas a
                long can range from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647 (long and other numeric data types may have another
                range on different computers, for example - from â€“9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807
                on 64-bit computer).

            <article>
                You can declare a variable in C:
                <p>
                    For numbers, we will usually use the type int, which an integer in the size of a "word" the default
                    number size of the machine which your program is compiled on. On most computers today, it is a
                    32-bit number, which means the number can range from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647.


                </p>
                <p>
                    To define the variables x and bar, we need to use the following syntax:
                    <code>int x = 42; <br>int bar = 1; </code>
                    The variable foo can be used, but since we did not initialize it, we don't know what's in it. The
                    variable bar contains the number 1.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now, we can do some math. Assuming <strong>a</strong>, <strong>b</strong>, <strong>c</strong>,<strong>d</strong>, and <strong>e</strong> are variables, we can simply use plus, minus
                    and multiplication operators in the following notation, and assign a new value to
                   <strong>a</strong> :<code>int a = 0, b = 1, c = 2, d = 3, e = 4; <br>a = b - c + d * e;<br>printf("%d", a);</code> 
                </p>

        <section class="main-section" id="Variable_scope">
            <header>Variable scope</header>
            <article>
                <p>
                    When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called
                    a global variable, because it is available to any other code in
                    the current document. When you declare a variable within a
                    function, it is called a local variable, because it is available
                    only within that function.
                </p>

            <article>
                <p>
                    Global variables are in fact properties of the global object. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Consequently, you can access global variables declared in one
                    window or frame from another window or frame by specifying the
                    window or frame name. For example, if a variable called<code>int phoneNumber</code> int
                    phoneNumber is declared in a document, you can refer to this
                    variable from an iframe as parent.phoneNumber.
                </p>
            </article>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Constants">
            <header>Constants</header>
            <article>
                <p>
                    You can create a read-only, named constant with the const keyword.
                    The syntax of a constant identifier is the same as for a variable
                    identifier: it must start with a letter, underscore or dollar sign
                    and can contain alphabetic, numeric, or underscore characters.
                </p>

                <code>const PI = 3.14;</code>
                <p>
                    A constant cannot change value through assignment or be
                    re-declared while the script is running. It has to be initialized
                    to a value.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The scope rules for constants are the same as those for let block
                    scope variables. If the const keyword is omitted, the identifier
                    is assumed to represent a variable.
                </p>

                <p>
                    You cannot declare a constant with the same name as a function or
                    variable in the same scope. For example:
                </p>

            <article>
                Use the if statement to execute a statement if a logical condition
                is true. Use the optional else clause to execute a statement if the
                condition is false. An if statement looks as follows:

                <code>if (condition) { statement_1; } else { statement_2; }</code>
                condition can be any expression that evaluates to true or false. See
                Boolean for an explanation of what evaluates to true and false. If
                condition evaluates to true, statement_1 is executed; otherwise,
                statement_2 is executed. statement_1 and statement_2 can be any
                statement, including further nested if statements.
                <p>
                    You may also compound the statements using else if to have
                    multiple conditions tested in sequence, as follows:
                </p>
                <code>if(boolean_expression) {
   /* statement(s) will execute if the boolean expression is true */
} else {
   /* statement(s) will execute if the boolean expression is false */
}

            <header>While and do...while Loop</header>
            <article>
                In programming, loops are used to repeat a block of code until a specified condition is met.

C programming has tree types of loops.:
<li>For Loop</li>
<li>While Loop</li>
<li>do...while Loop</li>

<h2>While Loop</h2>
<p>The syntax of the <strong>while loop</strong> is :</p>
<code>while (testExpression) 
{
    // statements inside the body of the loop 
}</code>

<h2>do...while loop</h2>
<p>The<strong> do...while</strong> is similiar to the while loop with one important difference.
The body of<strong> do...while</strong> loop is executed at least once. Only then, the test expressions is evaluated.</p>
<br>

<p>The syntax of the<strong> do...while loop is : </strong></p>
<code>do
{
   // statements inside the body of the loop
}
while (testExpression);
</code>

<p>The syntax of the<strong> for loop is : </strong></p>
<code>for (initializationStatement; testExpression; updateStatement)
{
    // statements inside the body of loop
}
</code>
